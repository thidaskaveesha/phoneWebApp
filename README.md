# phoneBook WebApp
The phonebook application is a comprehensive web-based tool developed by Thidas Kaveesha Senavirathna that allows users to efficiently manage their contact names and phone numbers. The application consists of a frontend and a backend, enabling a seamless user experience.

The frontend of the application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript framework known for its flexibility and performance. The use of React.js ensures a responsive and interactive user interface, providing a smooth navigation experience. Users can easily access and interact with various features of the phonebook application through the intuitive frontend.

On the backend, the application utilizes Node.js and Express.js, powerful JavaScript-based technologies for server-side development. These frameworks enable efficient handling of user requests, data retrieval, and database operations. The backend seamlessly communicates with the frontend, ensuring a smooth flow of information and actions.

To store and manage the contact information, the application employs MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database. MongoDB allows for efficient storage and retrieval of contact records, ensuring quick access to phone numbers and contact names. It also provides the necessary flexibility to accommodate future expansion and customization of the application.

As an added feature, the application includes robust validation mechanisms to prevent users from updating contact information with empty strings. This ensures that the phonebook maintains accurate and meaningful data, enhancing the overall usability and reliability of the application.

Overall, the phonebook web application offers users a convenient and user-friendly solution for managing their contact names and phone numbers. Its modern architecture, coupled with the efforts of Thidas Kaveesha Senavirathna, delivers an efficient and reliable tool that simplifies contact management tasks.
